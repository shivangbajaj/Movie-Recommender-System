# Movie Recommender System

Implementing **Collaborative Filtering Learning Algorithm** and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings ([MovieLens 100K Dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/100k/)).
This dataset consists of ratings on a scale of 1 to 5. The dataset has `943 users`, and `1682 movies`.

The objective of collaborative filtering is to predict movie ratings for the movies that users have not yet rated. This will allow us to recommend the movies with the highest predicted ratings to the user.
